# Black-Scholes in Python

- This mini project uses **Black-Scholes-Merton** (BSM) - a differential equation to assist option sellers in determining rational prices for the options. The model also anticipates that heavily traded assets follow a geometric Brownian motion with consistent drift and volatility.
- BSM theory suggests that assets, like stocks or futures, exhibit a lognormal price distribution over time due to a random walk with steady drift and volatility.
- When applied to stock options, it factors in the stock's price variability, time value of money, strike price, and time until expiration.
- The model takes five input variables: the strike price of an option, the current stock price, the time to expiration, the risk-free rate, and the volatility to price option contracts. <br>

## Features:
This project includes features to:

- Retrieve live stock prices from Yahoo Finance.
- Allow users to edit the risk-free rate (r), time to maturity (t), and volatility (sigma).
